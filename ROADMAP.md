# Roadmap

The big picture: turn a static landing page into a functional app where people in Dallas can find and connect with their birthday twins.

## Phase 1: A Real Landing Page

- Redesign the current page so it actually explains what this is
- Add a signup form (collect name, email, birthday, Dallas zip code)
- Store signups somewhere (database TBD)

## Phase 2: Birthday Matching

- Show users how many other people share their birthday
- Notify users when a new birthday twin signs up
- Basic profile pages

## Phase 3: Social Features

- Let birthday twins message each other
- Organize birthday meetups / group celebrations
- "Birthday Club" pages for each date (e.g., dallasbirthdayclub.com/jan-5)

## Open Questions

- Do we require Dallas residency or just Dallas-area? How do we define the boundary?
- Should matching be exact date (month + day + year) or just month + day?
- What's the tech stack going to be?
