# DallasBirthdayClub.com

A collaboration between Christopher Edgemon and [censored], who were both born on January 5, 1983 in Dallas, TX. They met in 5th grade attending the same school, and always dreamed of creating a website where people born on the same day who lived in Dallas could meet up and hang out.

That website is this website.

## What Is This?

Dallas Birthday Club connects people in the Dallas area who share the same birthday. Because the only thing better than celebrating your birthday is celebrating it with a stranger who was born on the exact same day as you.

## Development

This is currently a static site served by nginx. See `etc/nginx/` for server configuration.

The web root is `src/`.

## Deployment

The site is served from `/home/chris/www/dallasbirthdayclub.com/src/` on the production server via nginx.
