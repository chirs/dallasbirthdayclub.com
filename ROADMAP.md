# Roadmap

Turn a static site into a functional app where people in Dallas can find and connect with their birthday twins.

## Phase 1: Static Site ✅

- [x] Landing page that explains the concept
- [x] Application page with deadpan tone (static — no backend yet)

## Phase 2: Collect Signups

- [ ] Backend to receive and store form submissions (stack TBD)
- [ ] Wire up the signup form to the backend
- [ ] Confirmation email on signup

## Phase 3: Birthday Matching

- [ ] Match users who share the same month + day
- [ ] Notify users when a new birthday twin signs up
- [ ] Basic profile pages

## Phase 4: Social Features

- [ ] Let birthday twins message each other
- [ ] Organize birthday meetups / group celebrations
- [ ] Per-date pages (e.g., dallasbirthdayclub.com/jan-5)

## Open Questions

- Dallas city limits or broader metro area?
- Match on month + day, or exact date including year?
- Tech stack for the backend?
